Jakub Cwynar, Ewa Juralewicz, Jakub Michałowski

This project's goal is to visualize polish train delays in time, along with weather data and aims at helping to understand the causes and consequences of delays in Poland. In Q1 2019, almost 20% of trains operated by the biggest national operator, PKP Intercity, were delayed at least 6 minutes <b id="a1">[[1]](#f1)</b>. 
The polish railways operator, PKP PLK, publishes only current delays information, with data about past events. In this project we try to aggregate and visualize past delays.
